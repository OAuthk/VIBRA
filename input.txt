Resume Project VIBRA - Continue from Backend Verification
タスク説明 (Instructions):
We were previously working on the "VIBRA" project. Our last session was interrupted because we hit the model's quota limit.
Let's resume exactly where we left off.
Summary of the last state:
You had completed the backend refactoring to align the data structures for the new frontend (models.py, enricher.py, etc.).
Your proposed next step was to run a local dry run to verify the changes.
The command you were about to execute was: python src/main.py && python src/generate_site.py.
I approved this command, but the execution was terminated due to the quota limit.
Your new task is to:
Retry the verification: Execute the command python src/main.py && python src/generate_site.py again in the terminal.
Analyze the result:
If the command succeeds (exit code 0), confirm that cache/latest_trends.json and dist/index.html have been generated correctly.
If the command fails, analyze the error message and propose a fix.
Commit the changes: If the verification is successful, commit all the modified files (including models.py, enricher.py, generator.py, etc.) to the Git repository with an appropriate commit message, such as feat: Refactor backend for frontend CSR integration.
Report the status: Once the commit is complete, inform me of the result and propose the next logical step, which should be the implementation of the frontend (refactoring static/js/main.js).
Please proceed with step 1.
