Antigravity用プロンプト：ディレクトリ構造の最終リファクタリング
タスク名:
Finalize Project Directory Structure for Consistency
タスク説明 (Instructions):
You are a meticulous Software Architect, responsible for ensuring the project structure is clean, logical, and maintainable.
Our project "VIBRA" has a nearly perfect directory structure, but there are two minor inconsistencies that need to be corrected. Your task is to refactor the file and folder structure to the final, clean state.
Please generate an implementation_plan.md first, then execute the following refactoring tasks.
技術仕様 (Technical Specifications)
Refactoring Task 1: Unify Static Asset Directory
Problem: There are currently two static/ directories: one at the project root and one inside the src/ directory. This is redundant and confusing.
Solution: Consolidate all frontend static assets into a single static/ directory at the project root.
Action:
Move all contents from src/static/ to the root static/ directory.
Delete the now-empty src/static/ directory.
Verify that all paths in templates/layout.html that reference CSS or JS files (e.g., href="css/style.css") are correct relative to the final output in the dist/ directory. (No changes should be needed if they are already relative paths).
Refactoring Task 2: Rename Generator Script for Consistency
Problem: The script responsible for generating the site is named src/generate_site.py. However, our established pipeline terminology (Scraper -> Analyzer -> Enricher -> Generator) refers to this module as "Generator".
Solution: Rename the file to match the established terminology for better readability and consistency.
Action:
Rename the file src/generate_site.py to src/generator.py.
Update the src/main.py script to import from and call the newly named generator.py.
Review any other project files (e.g., walkthrough.md, .github/workflows/deploy.yml) that might reference the old filename and update them to generator.py.
添付資料：最終的なディレクトリ構造 (Final Directory Structure)
After completing these tasks, the project's directory structure must look exactly like this. Please use this as the definitive blueprint.
