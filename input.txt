Approved. Your analysis is perfectly correct.
You have accurately identified the root cause of the issue. The mismatch between the JSON structure generated by the backend and expected by the frontend is indeed the problem.
Your proposed changes to generator.py are the exact right solution.
Please proceed with implementing the changes as you have planned.
After modifying the code, run the verification plan. I am particularly interested in the content of the newly generated dist/trends.json.
